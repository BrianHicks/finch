<p>A task manager, written in Go. Finch implements the <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109980854493.html" title="Final Version">Final Version</a>
algorithm by <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/" title="Get Everything Done - Mark Forster">Mark Forster</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Grab the binaries from GitHub. Or to build specifically for your platform:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-sh"><pre>go get github.com/BrianHicks/finch
<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$GOPATH</span>/src/github.com/BrianHicks/finch
make finch
</pre></div>

<p>This will change in the future to be <code>go install</code>able, but it's gotta ship for
now! If it's a big deal for you, leave me a +1 on
<a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/finch/issues/1">#1</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>To sum up how this works: add tasks to a list, mark some as "selected" (always
starting with the oldest), then work through your selected list
newest-to-oldest. In Finch, the sequence would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ finch add email Jane about the meeting
Added "email Jane about the meeting"

$ finch add fix the holodeck
Added "fix the holodeck"

$ finch add eat lunch
Added "eat lunch"

$ finch select
0: email Jane about the meeting
1: fix the holodeck
2: eat lunch

$ finch select 0 2
Selecting "0"... selected "email Jane about the meeting"
Selecting "2"... selected "eat lunch"
Wrote 2 tasks to DB

$ finch next
eat lunch

# after lunch...

$ finch done
Marked "eat lunch" done

$ finch next
email Jane about the meeting

# but you decide that "email Jane about the meeting" can't be done now, or you
# do a little bit of work on it and are interrupted. FV says you should
# re-enter the task at the end of the list. So we have "delay" as well.

$ finch delay
Delayed "email Jane about the meeting"

$ finch select
0: fix the holodeck
1: email Jane about the meeting
</code></pre>

<p>To get descriptions of the commands, run <code>finch help</code> or <code>finch help [command]</code>.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, <code>go get github.com/BrianHicks/finch</code> (or <code>git clone</code>,
of course) should do the trick. You can run <code>make deps</code> to get everything.
Before you commit, please run <code>make test</code>, <code>make lint</code>, and <code>gofmt</code>. It'll make
everyone's lives easier.</p>

<p>Work on unreleased versions is done on "develop" and feature branches. If
anyone (including me) commits to master I'll be very unhappy. So to start
working on this using <a href="https://github.com/github/hub" title="Hub - hub helps you win at git">hub</a>:</p>

<pre><code>go get github.com/BrianHicks/finch
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/BrianHicks/finch
hub fork
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/yourfeature
</code></pre>

<p>If you have any thoughts about build tools please tell me! My email address is
in my Github profile if you don't want to just open an issue. This is my first
"real" go project and I'm open to changing things to fit with what the
community usually expects.</p>
