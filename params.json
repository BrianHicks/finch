Finch implements the [Final Version][fv]\r\nalgorithm by [Mark Forster][mf].\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nGrab the binaries from GitHub. Or to build specifically for your platform:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngo get github.com/BrianHicks/finch\r\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/BrianHicks/finch\r\nmake finch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will change in the future to be `go install`able, but it's gotta ship for\r\nnow! If it's a big deal for you, leave me a +1 on\r\n[#1](https://github.com/BrianHicks/finch/issues/1).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo sum up how this works: add tasks to a list, mark some as \"selected\" (always\r\nstarting with the oldest), then work through your selected list\r\nnewest-to-oldest. In Finch, the sequence would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ finch add email Jane about the meeting\r\nAdded \"email Jane about the meeting\"\r\n\r\n$ finch add fix the holodeck\r\nAdded \"fix the holodeck\"\r\n\r\n$ finch add eat lunch\r\nAdded \"eat lunch\"\r\n\r\n$ finch select\r\n0: email Jane about the meeting\r\n1: fix the holodeck\r\n2: eat lunch\r\n\r\n$ finch select 0 2\r\nSelecting \"0\"... selected \"email Jane about the meeting\"\r\nSelecting \"2\"... selected \"eat lunch\"\r\nWrote 2 tasks to DB\r\n\r\n$ finch next\r\neat lunch\r\n\r\n# after lunch...\r\n\r\n$ finch done\r\nMarked \"eat lunch\" done\r\n\r\n$ finch next\r\nemail Jane about the meeting\r\n\r\n# but you decide that \"email Jane about the meeting\" can't be done now, or you\r\n# do a little bit of work on it and are interrupted. FV says you should\r\n# re-enter the task at the end of the list. So we have \"delay\" as well.\r\n\r\n$ finch delay\r\nDelayed \"email Jane about the meeting\"\r\n\r\n$ finch select\r\n0: fix the holodeck\r\n1: email Jane about the meeting\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get descriptions of the commands, run `finch help` or `finch help [command]`.\r\n\r\n## Contributing/Development/Hacking\r\n\r\nFinch is licensed under the [Apache License](LICENSE.txt).

You can run `make deps` to get everything.\r\nBefore you commit, please run `make test`, `make lint`, and `gofmt`. It'll make\r\neveryone's lives easier.\r\n\r\nWork on unreleased versions is done on \"develop\" and feature branches. If\r\nanyone (including me) commits to master I'll be very unhappy. So to start\r\nworking on this using [hub][hub]:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo get github.com/BrianHicks/finch\r\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/BrianHicks/finch\r\nhub fork\r\ngit checkout develop\r\ngit checkout -b feature/yourfeature\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have any thoughts about build tools please tell me! My email address is\r\nin my Github profile if you don't want to just open an issue. This is my first\r\n\"real\" go project and I'm open to changing things to fit with what the\r\ncommunity usually expects.\r\n\r\n[mf]: http://markforster.squarespace.com/ \"Get Everything Done - Mark Forster\"\r\n[fv]: http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109980854493.html \"Final Version\"\r\n[hub]: https://github.com/github/hub \"Hub - hub helps you win at git\"\r\n[lhf]: https://github.com/brianhicks/finch/issues?labels=low-hanging+fruit&page=1&state=open \"Issues • BrianHicks/finch\"\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/brianhicks/finch/issues?state=open \"Issues • BrianHicks/finch\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
